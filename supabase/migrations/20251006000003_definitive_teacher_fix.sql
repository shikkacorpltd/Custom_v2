-- DEFINITIVE FIX: Add teacher permissions by directly querying user_roles and user_profiles
-- Avoids function call issues in RLS policies

-- Step 1: Drop all existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "School admins can manage students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "School members can view students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "School members can insert students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "School members can update students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "School admins can delete students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins manage all students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can select all students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can insert all students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can update all students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can delete all students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers and admins can view students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers and admins can insert students" ON public.students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers and admins can update students" ON public.students;

-- Step 2: Create new policies that include teachers (direct table queries)
