## Overview
Major improvements to the Teacher Dashboard creating a streamlined, role-based dashboard that displays only relevant subjects, tasks, and student interactions with quick access to daily activities.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Today's Tasks Overview** ðŸŽ¯
A dedicated section at the top showing:

- Active status badge
- Click to view full student details

**Data Source:**
```sql

LIMIT 5
```

### 3. **Upcoming Exams/Deadlines** ðŸ“…
Shows next 3 upcoming exams with:
- Exam name
- Scheduled date

AND is_active = true
ORDER BY exam_date ASC 
LIMIT 3
```

### 4. **Enhanced Quick Actions Grid** âš¡
Reorganized 6 action buttons with:

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```typescript
const [recentStudents, setRecentStudents] = useState<any[]>([]);

```

### Data Fetching Logic
Added to `fetchDashboardData()`:
1. Fetch recent students from teacher's classes
2. Fetch upcoming exams for the school
3. Join with classes table for student details
4. Filter by active status and teacher's assignments

### UI Components Structure

## User Experience Improvements

- Actions required multiple clicks to access

**After:**
- Role-specific data prioritized
- Today's tasks highlighted at the top
- Recent students visible immediately
- Upcoming deadlines shown prominently
- One-click access to all common actions
- Visual hierarchy improved with colors and gradients

### Mobile Optimization
- Responsive grid layouts (2 cols â†’ 1 col on mobile)
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Swipe gestures maintained for class cards
- Pull-to-refresh functionality intact
- Floating action button for quick attendance

## Navigation Flow

### Quick Access Paths

1. **Take Attendance:**
   - Click "Pending Tasks" card â†’ Attendance page
   - Click "Take Attendance" quick action
   - Swipe class card left
   - Click attendance button on class card
   - Click pending attendance alert in Today's Tasks

2. **View Students:**
   - Click "Total Students" card
   - Click "View Students" quick action
   - Click any student in Recent Students widget

3. **Access Subjects:**
   - Click "My Subjects" card â†’ Filtered subject list
   - Only shows subjects teacher teaches (via timetable)

4. **Check Schedule:**
   - Today's schedule always visible in dashboard
   - Click "Schedule" quick action for full timetable
   - Class cards show time, room, and student count

## Data Filtering by Role

### Teacher-Specific Data
All data is automatically filtered based on teacher's assignments:

- **Classes**: Only classes assigned in timetable
- **Students**: Only students in teacher's classes
- **Subjects**: Only subjects teacher teaches (from timetable)
- **Attendance**: Only for teacher's classes
- **Tasks**: Only pending items for teacher's classes

### Query Optimization
```typescript
// Get teacher's unique class IDs from timetable
const uniqueClassIds = [...new Set(teacherTimetable?.map(t => t.class_id))];

// Get teacher's unique subject IDs from timetable
const uniqueSubjectIds = [...new Set(teacherTimetable?.map(t => t.subject_id))];

// Use these IDs to filter all subsequent queries
```

## Visual Design Updates

### Color Scheme
- **Primary (Blue)**: Classes, schedule, main actions
- **Accent (Teal)**: Total students, secondary actions
- **Green**: Subjects, completed items, success states
- **Orange**: Pending tasks, alerts, schedule
- **Red**: Deadlines, exams, urgent items
- **Purple**: Lesson plans, resources
- **Blue**: Students, profiles

### Gradient Backgrounds
Each card uses subtle gradients:
```css
bg-gradient-to-br from-[color]/5 via-card to-[color]/3
```

### Hover Effects
```css
hover:shadow-elegant transition-all duration-300
group-hover:opacity-100
```

### Responsive Typography
```css
text-xs md:text-sm
text-2xl md:text-4xl
p-3 md:p-6
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized Queries
1. Use `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` for counts
2. Limit recent students to 5
3. Limit upcoming exams to 3
4. Single query for timetable, then filter in memory
5. Parallel queries where possible

### State Management
- Separate state for each widget
- Loading states maintained
- Error handling for each query
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- All clickable cards have cursor-pointer
- Buttons have proper focus states
- Touch targets meet minimum size (44x44px on mobile)

### Screen Readers
- Semantic HTML (CardTitle, CardHeader, etc.)

- Icons paired with descriptive text

### Visual Feedback
