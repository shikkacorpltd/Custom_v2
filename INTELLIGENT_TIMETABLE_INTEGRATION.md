# Intelligent Timetable & Subject Integration

## 🎯 Overview
Implemented intelligent timetable management with automated subject filtering, conflict detection, and role-based access control. The system now provides smart suggestions and prevents scheduling conflicts.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Filtering** 🔒
**Teachers:**
- See only their personal schedule ("My Schedule")
- Read-only view (no add/edit/delete buttons)
- Quick stats showing total classes, subjects, classes taught, and active days
- Personal view badge indicating filtered content

**Admins:**
- Full timetable management access
- Can view all teachers' schedules
- Complete CRUD operations
- Access to all filtering options

### 2. **Intelligent Subject Filtering** 🎓
**Automatic Class-Level Matching:**
- When a class is selected, subjects are automatically filtered by matching class level
- Visual "Match" badge shows subjects that match the selected class level
- Prevents assigning wrong-level subjects to classes
- Empty state message when no subjects match

**Example:**
```typescript
subjects.filter(subject => {
  const selectedClass = classes.find(c => c.id === formData.class_id);
  return !selectedClass || subject.class_level === selectedClass.class_level;
})
```

### 3. **Smart Teacher Assignment** 👨‍🏫
**Auto-Suggestion Based on Specialization:**
- When a subject is selected, the system automatically suggests teachers specialized in that subject
- Shows "Specialist" badge for teachers matching the subject
- Toast notification when auto-assignment occurs

**Real-time Availability Check:**
- Teachers who are already scheduled at the selected time show "Busy" badge
- Busy teachers are disabled in the dropdown (cannot be selected)
- Prevents double-booking teachers

**Visual Indicators:**
```
Teacher Name
Mathematics            [Specialist] [Busy]
```

### 4. **Advanced Conflict Detection** ⚠️
**Three-Level Conflict Check:**

1. **Teacher Conflict:**
   - Prevents assigning same teacher to multiple classes at the same time
   - Shows which class the teacher is already teaching

2. **Class Conflict:**
   - Prevents scheduling multiple subjects for the same class simultaneously
   - Ensures students aren't double-booked

3. **Room Conflict:**
   - Prevents booking same room for multiple classes at once
   - Shows which class is already using the room

**Real-time Validation:**
- Conflicts checked as user fills the form
- Red alert banners display all conflicts
- Submit button disabled until conflicts resolved

### 5. **Enhanced UI/UX** 🎨
**Quick Stats for Teachers:**
```
┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│Total Classes│  Subjects  │  Classes   │Days Active │
│     12     │      3     │      4     │      5     │
└────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
```

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Color-coded badges for status (Match, Specialist, Busy)
- Gradient backgrounds for cards
- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Responsive design from mobile to desktop
- Touch-friendly buttons

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Role-Based Data Fetching

```typescript
// For teachers, get their teacher record first
let teacherRecord = null;
if (profile?.role === 'teacher') {
  const { data: teacherData } = await supabase
    .from('teachers')
    .select('id')
    .eq('user_id', profile.user_id)
    .single();
  teacherRecord = teacherData;
}

// Filter timetable by teacher if teacher role
let timetableQuery = supabase
  .from('timetable')
  .select('*')
  .eq('school_id', profile.school_id);

if (profile?.role === 'teacher' && teacherRecord) {
  timetableQuery = timetableQuery.eq('teacher_id', teacherRecord.id);
}
```

### Auto-Teacher Assignment Logic

```typescript
onValueChange={(value) => {
  setFormData({ ...formData, subject_id: value });
  
  // Auto-suggest teacher based on subject specialization
  const selectedSubject = subjects.find(s => s.id === value);
  if (selectedSubject && !formData.teacher_id) {
    const matchingTeacher = teachers.find(t => 
      t.subject_specialization?.toLowerCase()
        .includes(selectedSubject.name.toLowerCase())
    );
    if (matchingTeacher) {
      setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, teacher_id: matchingTeacher.id }));
      toast.success(`Auto-assigned ${matchingTeacher.full_name}`);
    }
  }
}}
```

### Conflict Detection Algorithm

```typescript
const checkConflicts = (data: typeof formData) => {
  const conflicts: string[] = [];
  
  // Check teacher conflict
  const teacherConflict = timetableEntries.find(entry => 
    entry.teacher_id === data.teacher_id &&
    entry.day_of_week === data.day_of_week &&
    entry.time_slot === data.time_slot &&
    (!editingEntry || entry.id !== editingEntry.id)
  );
  
  if (teacherConflict) {
    conflicts.push(`Teacher already scheduled for ${teacherConflict.class_name}`);
  }
  
  // Check class conflict
  const classConflict = timetableEntries.find(entry => 
    entry.class_id === data.class_id &&
    entry.day_of_week === data.day_of_week &&
    entry.time_slot === data.time_slot &&
    (!editingEntry || entry.id !== editingEntry.id)
  );
  
  if (classConflict) {
    conflicts.push(`Class already has a scheduled period`);
  }
  
  // Check room conflict
  if (data.room_number) {
    const roomConflict = timetableEntries.find(entry => 
      entry.room_number === data.room_number &&
      entry.day_of_week === data.day_of_week &&
      entry.time_slot === data.time_slot &&
      (!editingEntry || entry.id !== editingEntry.id)
    );
    
    if (roomConflict) {
      conflicts.push(`Room ${data.room_number} already booked`);
    }
  }
  
  return conflicts.length === 0;
};
```

2. **Client-Side Joining:** Manual joins to avoid complex Supabase joins
3. **Filtered Queries:** Only fetch relevant data based on role
4. **Caching:** Teacher record cached during fetch

### Conflict Checking
- Runs on form change (debounced)
- Uses in-memory array filtering
- No additional database queries
- Instant feedback
