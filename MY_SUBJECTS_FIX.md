# My Subjects Navigation Fix - Complete

## 🔧 Issue
Teachers could not navigate to "My Subjects" section when clicking the card on the dashboard.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added onClick Handler to Dashboard Card
**File**: `src/components/TeacherDashboard.tsx`

Added click functionality to the "My Subjects" card:
```tsx
<Card 
  className="... cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => setActiveModule?.('subjects')}
>
```

### 2. Added Subjects Route for Teachers
**File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx`

Added 'subjects' case to teacher role switch:
```tsx
if (profile?.role === 'teacher') {
  switch (activeModule) {
    case 'students': return <StudentManagement />;
    case 'subjects': return <SubjectManagement />; // ✅ ADDED
    case 'attendance': return <AttendanceManagement />;
    // ... rest of cases
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Sidebar Menu Item
**File**: `src/components/AppSidebar.tsx`

Added "My Subjects" to teacher sidebar navigation:
```tsx
{
  title: "My Subjects",
  url: "#",
  icon: BookOpen,
  module: "subjects"
}
```

## 🎯 Result

Teachers can now access Subject Management through:

1. ✅ **Dashboard Card** - Click "My Subjects" card
2. ✅ **Sidebar Menu** - Click "My Subjects" in sidebar
3. ✅ **Direct URL** - Navigate directly to subjects module
